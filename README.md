## üîç Project Overview

This project explores the **divide and conquer approach** for implementing **distributed logistic regression** and **support vector machine (SVM)** algorithms in the context of large-scale binary classification tasks. In our approach:

1. The dataset is **partitioned** across multiple processors or nodes.
2. Each subset is processed independently using either **logistic regression** or **SVM**, producing local classifiers.
3. These local models are then **aggregated** to form a **global classifier** capable of making final predictions.

We investigate three aggregation strategies:
- **Voting** based on predicted class labels,
- **Averaging** of raw real-valued predictions,
- **Averaging of posterior probabilities**.

**Key Findings**:
- For distributed **logistic regression**, **posterior probability averaging** offers the most robust performance and is the recommended approach.
- For distributed **SVM**, posterior probability averaging adds modeling complexity without significant gains. Thus, **functional (real-valued) averaging** is preferred.
